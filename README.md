## Introduction
[【中文文档】](./doc/README_ZH.md) [【日本語の文書】](./doc/README_JA.md) [【한국어】](./doc/README_KR.md)

Many excellent projects have extensive comments to help users quickly understand the code's intent. If users are not familiar with the language of the comments, it can be challenging to understand. This extension provides multiple translation scenarios to help developers comprehend and write multilingual code more easily. It supports common translation services like Google, Bing, AliCloud, and DeepL, and allows developers to add custom translation services.

## Features

### Code Reading
The extension identifies multilingual content like comments and strings in the source code using TextMate, translates them quickly, and displays them via Hover, minimizing disruption to development.

**Hover Translation**: Move the mouse over comments, strings, or selected areas to see the translated content in a hover box. Other hover content like exceptions and code documentation are also translated and displayed.

**Immersive Reading**: Turn on immersive comment translation to automatically translate comments and display them in the document. The translated results can be shown alongside the original text or in place of it; toggle the display mode with `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

### Translation and Replacement
The extension can translate source code content and quickly replace it in the document. For instance, translate a description and use it as a variable name; in multilingual development scenarios, translate a string and replace it in the document.

**Translate Variable Naming**: Translate the current description into English and provide various variable names to choose from, then replace the original description.

**Hover Replacement**: The hover box provides the ability to replace text with the translation result, which replaces the original content.
